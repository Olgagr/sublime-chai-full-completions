## Full completions for the Chai Assertion Library

This sublime package will install completions for *bdd* and *tdd*:
- [*should*](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- [*expect*](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- [*assert*](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)

You can read the [full API for chai syntax](http://chaijs.com/api/).

The completions work in both Javascript and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

Alternately, you can use [pahen's Assert completions ](https://github.com/pahen/sublime-chai-completions) if you're not interested in any of the BDD syntax.

### Installation
Install with [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) if possible.
- Super + Shift + P
- Install Package
- Chai Full Completions

or without Sublime Package Control:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
git clone git://github.com/pensive612/sublime-chai-full-completions.git
```
restart Sublime Text and you're good to go.


Improvements and suggestions are welcome...
